# js-tutorial
This is a repository to showcase my work that has been done as part of a tutorial course that I have been doing.

These ideas are NOT MINE - I followed an online course about JavaScript and these tasks were made with a help of that same course.
I personally decided to showcase it because the code has been modified a bit by me and it is my first ever interaction with HTML, CSS and JS.
